PDFs of all papers are available on the <a href="publications.html">Publications</a> page.</li>
									<li><b>May 2022</b>: Congratulations to Dr. Samuel Baugh for successfully defending his dissertation! In August, Sam will begin a post-doc in the <a href="https://cascade.lbl.gov/">CASCADE group</a> at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, working on advancing methods in detection and attribution.  
									</li>
									<li><b>January 2022</b>: Congratulations to PhD candidate <a href="https://samjbaugh.github.io/">Sam Baugh</a> for the acceptance of his first PhD paper, Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling of Ocean Heat Content and Its Uncertainty (preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09717">here</a>), in Annals of Applied Statistics, AND for being awarded the NSF Post-doctoral Fellowship in Statistics!   
									</li>
									<li><b>December 2021</b>: Professor Karen McKinnon is now jointly appointed with the <a href="https://atmos.ucla.edu/">Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</a>!
									</li>
									<li><b>October 2021</b>: Professor Karen McKinnon was selected as a 2021 Packard Fellow for Science and Engineering. Read more from UCLA <a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/dept/faculty/karen-mckinnon-packard-fellowship">here</a>, and about all the Packard Fellows <a href="https://www.packard.org/insights/news/meet-the-2021-class-of-packard-fellows-for-science-and-engineering/">here</a>.</li>
									<li><b>September 2021</b>: Welcome to Dr. Suqin Duan, the newest member of the McKinnon group! Suqin is joining our NSF-funded project on the land surface and atmospheric contribution to daily temperature variability and extremes.</li>
									<li><b>August 2021</b>: Congratulations to post-doc Wenwen Kong on being awarded an Institute for Digital Research and Education Postdoctoral Fellowship in recognition of her work that features "innovative and computationally based solutions to research problems with a potentially broad impact to the campus".</li>
									<li><b>June 2021</b>: Professor Karen McKinnon was selected as a UCLA Hellman Fellow to support new work on marine heat waves.</li>
									<li><b>June 2021</b>: Our new paper, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01076-9">Hot extremes have become drier in the United States Southwest</a>, is out. We find that summertime specific humidity has been decreasing over the past seven decades in the semi-arid Southwest, particularly on the hottest days, which is bad news for fire risk. Coverage in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/climate/climate-change-southwest-humidity.html">New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2021-06-17/california-hottest-driest-days-getting-drier-worsening-fire-risk-boiling-point">LA Times</a>.</li>
									<li><b>June 2021</b>: Congratulations to Sam Baugh for being awarded a Dissertation Year Fellowship and a Summer Mentored Research Fellowship to support the last year+ of his PhD research! Sam's research is on developing spatial models for climate data, including ocean heat content. Find out more at his <a href="https://samjbaugh.github.io/">website</a>.</li>
									<li><b>March 2021</b>: Congratulations to Russell Horowitz for completing his masters thesis, <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5wm7g6dj">Circulation and Soil Moisture Contributions to United States Heatwaves</a>!</li>
									<li><b>October 2020</b>: Welcome to Dr. Wenwen Kong, the newest member of the McKinnon group! Wenwen joins us as an NSF-funded postdoctoral scholar, and will be working on understanding the role of the land surface in influencing temperature variability and extremes.</li>
									<li><b>May 2020</b>: New paper roundup! <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/h774zw2fr838rkx/McKinnonPoppick2020_JABES.pdf?raw=1">McKinnon and Poppick</a> develop a method to quantify changes in daily temperature-humidity relationships; <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/s3vzsvz25qcwvp2/DeserEA2020_NatureClimateChange.pdf?raw=1">Deser and the Large Ensemble Working Group</a> present a perspective on the utility of large climate model ensembles; and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/sr44j6xpct2xf04/ElsworthEA2020_CCCR.pdf?raw=1">Elsworth et al.</a> apply the Observational Large Ensemble methodology to ocean chlorophyll concentrations.</li>
