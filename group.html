								<h4>Karen McKinnon</h4>
								<p>Associate Professor, Statistics and Data Science, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Institute of the Environment and Sustainability</p>
							</header>
							<p>Karen McKinnon is a professor of Statistics and the Environment at the University of California, Los Angeles. Her research sits at the nexus of climate change and statistics, and is aimed at improving our understanding and prediction of climate extremes, variability, and change. She is a 2024 NSF CAREER awardee, a 2023 Kavli Fellow, and a 2021 Packard Fellow in Science and Engineering, and she has served as an advisor for both city governments and private companies regarding climate change. Prof. McKinnon received her B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. from Harvard University, as well as an M.Sc. from Victoria University of Wellington. She was an Advanced Study Program post-doc at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and an Applied Scientist at Descartes Labs before joining UCLA. <br><br>

					<h3>Information for all prospective group members</h3>
				</header>

				<p>Research in the McKinnon group is on the physical climate system, including the development of novel statistical and machine learning methodologies to answer scientific questions about the climate system. <b>A strong quantitative background (including in statistics, computer science, physics, and applied math) is strongly encouraged, and is more important than a background in earth or atmospheric science specifically.</b> Research areas include weather extremes (heat, humidity, precipitation), wildfire, internal variability across timescales, land/atmosphere interactions, and the climate response to human influences. If you are interested more broadly in questions related to sustainability or the social sciences as related to the environment, please contact other relevant faculty members at the <a href="https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/people/faculty/">Institute of the Environment and Sustainability</a>. </p>

					<h3>Prospective undergraduate students</h3>
				</header>
				<!--
				<p>Undergraduates are an important part of the McKinnon group. In most cases, undergraduate researchers work in a group of 2-3 on a self-contained project advised by myself and a senior PhD student or post-doc. In general, undergraduates who want to join the group should have experience coding (python preferred), an ability to commit to research for at least one academic year, and a desire to learn how to perform independent research. If this sounds like you, and you are excited to work on problems in climate science and/or related statistical methods, please email me with a short statement explaining your interests and background, as well as your CV. If I do not have open positions at the time of your email, I will get in touch when a position becomes available.</p>-->

				<p>At this time, I am not able to take on undergraduate students in the group. Please check back in later!</p>

					<h3>Prospective graduate students</h3>
				</header>

				<p>Applications for starting a PhD in Fall 2026 will open in Fall 2025.</p>
				<!--
				<p>I am recruiting for 1-2 fully-funded PhD students to work on heat extremes and land/atmosphere interactions funded through my recently awarded NSF CAREER grant (summarized by NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2338237&HistoricalAwards=false">here</a>). Students can apply and be admitted through either the <a href="https://aos.ucla.edu/">Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</a> or the <a href="http://statistics.ucla.edu/">Department of Statistics and Data Science</a>.</p>
				<p> If you are interested in this opportunity, please reach out by email with your CV and a brief statement of your relevant background and interest. Kindly preface your subject line with "Heat extremes PhD". 
				</p>

<!--
				<p>
					 I can admit students through the <a href="http://statistics.ucla.edu/">Department of Statistics</a>, the <a href="https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/">Institute of the Environment and Sustainability</a>, and the <a href="https://aos.ucla.edu/">Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</a>. Your experience doing research in my group will be the same regardless of which program you apply to; however, the course requirements and funding structures are different. Please explore the websites of the different programs to figure out what seems to meet your needs best, and get in touch with the academic administrators if you have further questions about the logistics and requirements of each program.<br>
					<br>
					Note that I find it most equitable, efficient, and helpful to wait to chat by phone or zoom with prospective students until <i>after</i> applications have been submitted. However, you are welcome and encouraged to send me an email letting me know that you will be applying to UCLA and are interested in the group, and I can provide brief thoughts on which program may be the best fit, if helpful. If the application fee is an undue burden, please do get in touch with the relevant department about a waiver. This will not affect how your application is assessed.-->

					<h3>Prospective post-docs</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I am currently recruiting for a post-doc to work on land-atmosphere interactions and their role in heat extremes funded by my <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2338237&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF CAREER award</a>. Read more about the position <a href="McKinnon_group_postdoc_heat.pdf">here</a> and apply <a href="https://recruit.apo.ucla.edu/analyst/recruitments/JPF10310">here</a>.</p>
				<p>	In addition, please reach out if you want to discuss post-doctoral fellowship options. In your email, please include the fellowship(s) you are interested in applying to, your CV, and a pargraph or two of your background, research interests, and goals for your postdoc. Some potential funding sources for post-docs are the <a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc">NOAA Global Change post-doc</a>, the various <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/education.jsp?fund_type=3">NSF post-docs</a>, the <a href="https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/overview/">Schmidt Science Fellows</a>, and the <a href="https://ppfp.ucop.edu/info/">University of California President’s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program</a> for female and minority PhD recipients. For those interested in climate change impacts to ecosystems, the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/programs/climate-adaptation-science-centers/climate-adaptation-postdoctoral-cap-fellows-program">USGS Climate Adaptation Postdoctoral Fellows Program</a> may also be of interest.
