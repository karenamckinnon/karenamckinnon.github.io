								<h4>Karen McKinnon</h4>
								<p>Assistant Professor, Statistics, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Institute of the Environment</p>
							</header>
							<p>Karen McKinnon is a professor of Statistics and the Environment, and the Pritzker Chair in Environment and Sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles. Her research sits at the nexus of climate change and statistics, and is aimed at improving our understanding and prediction of climate extremes, variability, and change. She is a 2021 Packard Fellow in Science and Engineering, and has served as an advisor for both city governments and private companies regarding climate change. Prof. McKinnon received her B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. from Harvard University, as well as an M.Sc. from Victoria University of Wellington. She was an Advanced Study Program post-doc at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and an Applied Scientist at Descartes Labs before joining UCLA. <br><br>

								<h4>Suqin Duan</h4>
								<p>Postdoctoral Scholar, Institute of the Environment</p>
							</header>
							<p>Suqin is a postdoctoral scholar at the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, UCLA. She works with Prof. Karen McKinnon at UCLA and Dr. Isla Simpson at NCAR to understand the role of large scale atmospheric circulation and land surface in affecting temperature variability. She will apply a variety of statistical methods to predict the temperature distribution. Previously, she was a postdoctoral research associate in the Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Princeton University, working with Prof. Stephan Fueglistaler and Dr. Kirsten Findell. She completed her Ph.D. in 2019 working on water isotopes and tropical convection, advised by Prof. Jonathon Wright at Tsinghua University and Prof. David Romps at UC Berkeley. <br><br>

							<p>Wenwen is a postdoctoral scholar at the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability, UCLA. She received her Ph.D. in 2020 from the Department of Geography at the University of California, Berkeley, where she worked with John Chiang on seasonal transitions of the East Asian summer monsoon. Her research bridges observations, theory, and numerical modeling to understand the dynamics of regional climate, from the past to the future. At the IoES, she collaborates with Karen McKinnon at UCLA and Isla Simpson from NCAR to explore the role of the land surface in influencing temperature variability.<br><br>

					<h3>Prospective undergraduate students</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Undergraduates are an important part of the McKinnon group. In most cases, undergraduate researchers work in a group of 2-3 on a self-contained project advised by myself and a senior PhD student or post-doc. In general, undergraduates who want to join the group should have experience coding (python preferred), an ability to commit to research for at least one academic year, and a desire to learn how to perform independent research. If this sounds like you, and you are excited to work on problems in climate science and/or related statistical methods, please email me with a short statement explaining your interests and background, as well as your CV. If I do not have open positions at the time of your email, I will get in touch when a position becomes available.</p>

				<header>
					<h3>Prospective graduate students</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					Applications for the 2022-2023 academic year have closed. In general, I can admit students through the <a href="http://statistics.ucla.edu/">Department of Statistics</a>, the <a href="https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/">Institute of the Environment and Sustainability</a>, and the <a href="https://aos.ucla.edu/">Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</a>. Your experience doing research in my group will be the same regardless of which program you apply to; however, the course requirements and funding structures are different. Please explore the websites of the different programs to figure out what seems to meet your needs best, and get in touch with the academic administrators if you have further questions about the logistics and requirements of each program.<br>
					<br>
					If you decide to apply to one of the above programs to work with me, feel free to reach out by email to give me a heads up that you've applied. Note that I find it most equitable, efficient, and helpful to chat with prospective students once applications have been submitted. If the application fee is an undue burden, please do get in touch with the relevant department about a waiver. This will not affect how your application is assessed.
				</p>

				<header>
					<h3>Prospective post-docs</h3>
				</header>
				<p>
					I will be formally advertising for post-doc positions in the near future, funded by the Packard Fellowship. Have a cool idea that you want to work on, related to the research in the group? Please drop me an email saying hi, and telling me about it.<br>
					<br>
					In addition, be in touch if you are interested in applying to a post-doctoral fellowship to work together. Some potential funding sources for post-docs are the <a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc">NOAA Global Change post-doc</a>, the various <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/education.jsp?fund_type=3">NSF post-docs</a>, the <a href="https://www.jsmf.org/apply/fellowship/">McDonnell Foundation post-doc</a>, and the <a href="https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/overview/">Schmidt Science Fellows</a>.
